#  Search indexing
#  ---------------
# Terms:
#  * Document - unit of search result. Documents have a 32bit id, data, terms,
#  and values.
#       * Data - binary blob, opaque to the engine. You can put the whole body
#       of a document here, or abstracts, or references to the real thing. For
#       email, this would probably be a message-id and/or mailfolder+UID
#       * terms - queryable data. Links to docuements, sortof. Terms can also
#       be field associated (e.g. sender vs body vs date)
#           * xapian supports mapping a field to multiple field prefixes
#           * We could use that such that To and CC map to recipient, and To,
#           CC, From, etc. map to person, etc.
#           * Check the Xapian conventions ('A' for author, etc) for a default
#           set of prefixes before running with our own.
#       * values - advanced topic for advanced searches 
#           * can be sorting keys
#           * can be weight (document importance)
#           * can be numeric values for range sort (dates come to mind)
#           * Values are stored into a slot between 0x0 and 0xfffffffe
#           * values contain opaque binary strings
#   * MSet - Match Set. A page (offset and count) of matches to a query.

    According to the RFC:
        Data can be an atom, number, string, parenthesized list, or NIL.
        An atom consists of one or more non-special characters.
        A number consists of digits
        A string is either literal (has a length in braces followed, followed

        quotes)
        A parenthesized list is a nesting structure for all of the data
        formats.
        NIL is like C's NULL or Python's None. Indicates absense of a
        parameter, distinct from an empty string or empty list.

        The special characters that aren't allowed in atoms are parenthesis,
        open curly brace, space, control characters (0x00-0x1f and 0x7f),
        list-wildcards (percent and asterisk), and quoted-specials (double
        quote and backslash).

        In a quote, a backslash provides for denoting a literal. E.g. "\"" is
        a string whose value is a double quote.

    This implementation is currently incomplete. It doesn't handle the \ escape

        """Parse a message list specification string into a list of matching message IDs.

        According to the mailx manpage (under "Specifying messages") many
        commands can take a list of message numbers and operate on those
        multiple messages.

        Values can be a space separated list of ranges, or special names. The
        ranges are inclusive. However, if using special names, you cannot give
        multiple.

        E.g.
            5                  -> 5
            5 10               -> 5,10
            5-10               -> 5,6,7,8,9,10
            1-3 5-8 10-12      -> 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11,12
            :u                 -> all unread messages
            1-3 :u             -> invalid specification, though heirloom-mailx equates to just :u
            :u :f              -> invalid specification, heirloom-mailx shows an error

        The resulting list is always in numerical ascending order
            5 3 1 10           -> 1,3,5,10

        The list is in thread/sort order of the message list. Changing the
        sort order likely invalidates the lists.

        As an extension, we'll allow mixing these. I don't see any reason to
        not allow unread messages and also message 5-10, for example. Or a
        list including unread, flagged, and flagged unread messages (":u :f').
        Essentially, the list outside parenthesis is a union. In parenthesis
        is intersection by default (boolean AND) unless using the explicit or
        operator.

        The full list of specials, according to the man page, are:

            :n      All new messages
            :o      All old messages (not read or new)
            :u      All unread messages
            :d      All deleted messages (used in undelete command)
            :r      All read messages
            :f      All flagged messages
            :a      All answered messages (replied)
            :t      All messages marked as draft
            :k      All killed messages
            :j      All junk messages
            .       The current message
            ;       The previously current message (using ; over and over
                    bounces between the last 2 messages)
            ,       The parent of the current message (looking for the message
                    with the Message-Id matching the current In-Reply-To or
                    last References entry
            -       (hyphen) The next previous undeleted message for regular
                    commands or the next previus deleted message for undelete.
            +       The next undeleted message, or the next deleted message
                    for undelete.
            ^       The first undeleted message, or first deleted for the
                    undelete command.
            $       The last message
            &x      The message 'x' and all messages from the thread that
                    begins at it (in thread mode only). X defaults to '.' if
                    not given.
            *       (asterisk) All messages.
            `       (back tick) All messages listed in the previous command
            /str    All messages with 'str' in the subject field, case
                    insensitive (ASCII). If empty, use last search "of that
                    type", whatever that means
            addr    Messages from address 'addr', normally case sensitive for
                    complete email address. Some variables change the
                    processing.
            (cri)   Messages matching an IMAP-style SEARCH criterion.
                    Performed locally if necesary, even when not on IMAP
                    connections.  if 'cri' is empty, reuse last search.

        (cri) is a complicated beasty, see the full documentation for details (from mailx until we have our own).
        As a simplification, we might just pass these literally to the IMAP server.

        Some commands don't take a list, but set the list. For example, the
        implicit command only prints one message (usually the next message).
        When using the back-tick, it will start with the first message in the
        last list, and reset the list. A subsequent run of back tick selects
        the second message, but maintains the list. The next back tick run
        shows the third, and so on.

        We note that there might be additional criteria someone might want to
        assign a shortcut to (for example, some IMAP servers support custom
        flags or labels/tags for messages to help organize them), and only 10
        of the 26 letters of the ASCII alphabet are used, and none of the
        uppercase letters are used. For that matter, nothing stops us from
        using whole words after the ':'. heirloom-mailx only pays attention to
        the first letter (e.g. :uf is interpreted as :u, :fu is interpreted as
        :f). So, we'll support single letters for user shortcuts and full
        words for tag names. This can lead to ambiguity if you have a tag
        named by a single letter. My inclination is to allow the names to be
        quoted.

        In a similar vein, we'd like to be able to have saved lists, akin to
        Vim registers or marks. Since mailx already uses '`' to reference the
        last list, we'll use `x to reference named list x. For simplicity, we
        should keep the lists volatile (switching the active mailbox clears
        all lists). Some issues to resolve with having saved lists persist is
        handling changes to the mailbox. Even keeping it volatile, the mailbox
        IDs can change on us (e.g. another client deleting a message).
        Ideally, we'd detect this and correct the numbers in the list to keep
        track (while watching a box), and remove entries from the list that
        are no longer in the box. For persistent lists, we'd probably have to
        key on UIDs and wipe lists with non-matching UIDVALIDITY. No idea how
        to handle this for local or pop boxes. Probably easiest to not support
        that (everyone should run an IMAP server, even just to export their
        own mail! j/k, but only somewhat).

        Now, this actually breaks compatibility with heriloom-mailx, which
        interprets tokens after the `.

        For example, if we do 'f^$' (and message 6337 happens to be the last
        message), then the list becomes 1,6337.
        If we then do 'f`4', the list becomes 1,4,6337.

        However, if we then do 'f`test@example.com', it tells us there aren't
        any messages form test@example.com.
        But, then if we do 'f test@example.com', it will list the messages
        from test and set the new list. Odd.

        I'm hoping noone relies on this behavior in their workflow, but
        perhaps we should have a setting to use something resembling the old
        behavior. I doubt I could spec the actual old behavior outside of the
        actual program code that interpreted it.

        Another issue is that the mailx format precludes math, even though ed
        (supposedly the inspiration for the command line) /does/ allow math,
        and I've found myself wanting it several times in my daily mailx
        usage. For example, if I'm on message 6748, and I remembered seeing
        something in the previous message, I just type '-' and mailx shows me
        the previous message (6747), which is great. When I'm done, I want to
        look at the next message. However, I've already seen 6748, so I want
        to go to 6749. However, to get there I either have to iterate using
        '+' or '' (just pressing enter shows the next message) viewing an
        already viewed message (wasting network and terminal bandwidth, and my
        time), or type the whole message number (6749) which is both a lot of
        numbers and requires me to know the message number I was just at (but
        I've been moving relatively, so I don't know without doing a 'headers'
        command or paying attention to the message header when it printed a
        message to my pager).

        Ideally, I ought to be able to do something like '.+2', or really '.'
        plus or minus any number. However, mailx doesn't recognize the plus
        like that, and the minus is already used for ranges.

        Recognizing the plus shouldn't be hard, but differentiating between a
        ranging hyphen and subtraction is tougher. Our parser either needs to
        differentiate between starting with a dot vs a number (and thus
        disallow straight numerical math, which also might be useful to
        someone for selecting a message), or we need the option to use a
        different range character. IMAP uses a colon (':') for ranging, but
        that can get confusing with the shortcuts (e.g. ':u') without writing
        a smarter parser. Vim uses comma for ranging. This might work, because
        comma currently is used only on its own to refer to the current
        parent, never with another character (e.g. you can't spec the parent
        of a different message (say, message 1234) by doing '1234,' or
        ',1234', though oddly if you try either, mailx finds the comma and
        ignores the number).

        It might also be a bit more intuitive to today's users to use Git's parent
        notation (e.g. the parent of 123 would be 123^ or 123~1). This could
        be fairly convenient for a message that is in reply to multiple
        messages, though I don't know that MIME supports that, because the Git
        notation lets you select which parent (e.g. 123^2 picks the second
        parent). Of course, the caret/circumflex ('^') is already special,
        though tilde ('~') is available.

        Other annoying quirks of mailx:

            :d only works in the undelete command. You cannot list deleted
            messages by doing 'f :d' for example. You cannot display a deleted
            message by using :d or by giving the actual message number. You
            have to undelete it before it is accessible again.

        #
        # Then, based on what it is, we can continue parsing.
        #
        # NOTE: The main message might have a disposition header, set to
        # attachment. We would display no content, just prompt the user to
        # maybe save the file or explicitly open it. Opening might be tricky
        # for the actual top level, since we don't currently have a way to
        # differentiate the whole message from the primary contents. Maybe do
        # '.0' or something? Similar issue for the multipart containing a
        # message/rfc822 vs the header in the rfc882 itself.
        #
        # So, whenever we have a message/rfc822 (which is implicitly the top
        # layer), check the message headers. Otherwise check the MIME headers.
        # Make sure this is done in the order of hierarchy (example below)
        #
        # Things we know:
        #  * Multipart/mixed: process each sub-part in turn
        #  * Multipart/alternative: Scan for the best type we understand
        #  * Multipart/signed: check signature in second part against message
        #  in first part (unless told not to), then display sig status and
        #  then try to show the first part using above rules (recurse into it)
        #  * text/plain: easy, show the text after undoing transfer encoding
        #  and converting charset to the output device
        #
        # We might in the future know some others (we could probably implement
        # the RFC rich text email format to an extent, though I'm unaware of
        # any MUA that actually generates it. Or maybe we'll do some HTML
        # parsing, who knows?).
        #
        # Example 1:
        #   multipart/mixed
        #     multipart/alternative
        #       text/plain
        #       text/html
        #     text/plain
        #     image/png
        #
        # hit multipart/mixed, walk each child
        #   hit multipart/alternative, search child types for best
        #   presentation (will be text/plain as only one recognized)
        #       render text/plain
        #   hit (outer) text/plain. Render it
        #   hit image/png, show as attachment instead of rendering.
        #
        # If the (outer) text/plain or the alternative were marked as
        # attachment, they'd be not rendered as well. The contents of the
        # alternative would be odd to be marked, but we'd follow that too.
        #
        # If the png is explicitly inlined, we could either try to render it,
        # or mark is as unrenderable, able to be saved, but supposed to be
        # inlined (e.g. it'd act like an attachment, but we shouldn't call it
        # an attachment, since that wasn't the intent)
        #
        # For rendering, the img2txt program (from caca-utils) might be a good
        # option.

    In the other, the user has multiple valid box names but only one identity. This covers the second
    case for now.

    For example, your company might have an alias "sales@example.com" that drops into several boxes,
    and the user is at "foo@example.com". User foo, on replying to a sales email, may want to not
    have sales end up in the to or cc list. Foo would have sales@example.com as an altfrom in this case.

    # ^-- some notes on the above: Perhaps a more generic mechanism is a
    # mapping of email addresses to from fields. E.G. foo@example.com and
    # foo2@example.com map to "Foo User" <foo@example.com>, but
    # sales@example.com gets mapped to "Sales Enquiries" <sales@example.com>.

    # things a user might want to do, such as different autocc per identity.
    # Perhaps what we really need to do is something akin to mailx account
    # settings, but for identities. The combo of an identity's 'from' and
    # 'altfrom' settings cause identity selection, first selection wins
    # default (unless a priority list is given), and the user can change
    # identity during message composition. When changing, we can list detected
    # identities, but allow user to select any identity.
    #
    # This is more complicated, because we'd have to keep track of the
    # addresses that were culled from the to/cc lists from the default
    # identity to be able to put them back on an identity change.
