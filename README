Goals:
    be like mailx, supporting the useful bits of bsd-mailx and heirloom-mailx.
    Add features that most people expect should have been implemented long ago
        * PGP format signing/encryption
        * subpart referencing and display (e.g. syntax to explicitly save an
          attachment without having to 'write /dev/null' and work your way
          through all of the parts)
        * readline or similar
        * notifications (in particular, new mail received)
        * address book search while selecting email addresses
            * support external program (e.g. khard)
            * possibly support "recent" addresses, like kmail used to
              (kmail still has the feature, but it currently only stores
              the username and host with no other data, like full name)
        * Somewhat better calendar support
            for example, a multipart/alternative with a text/calendar part
            should default to displaying a processed version of the text/
            calendar part instead of defaulting to the text/plain. There
            are some emailers (google? outlook.com?) that send a set of
            text/plain,text/html,text/calendar and leave the text/plain
            and text/html EMPTY! very frustrating!
        * Support accellerated full-body search
            * posibly using Xapian, Sphinx, or Lucene, or "notmuch"
        * Support storing mail lists (not mailing lists) into variables, like
          vim registers
            * mostly useful for saving search results for re-use.
              for example, I'll do a complicated IMAP style search that takes
              2 minutes. I want to read the 3rd result, then the 5th, then
              review the list again or whatever. In current heirloom-mailx,
              the moment I move to a particular message, that replaces the
              current mail list with that one message, so to retrieve the list
              I have to reperform the 2 minute search.
            * Support searching within a mail list.
              For example, I perform one search which gives me a list of say
              50 messages. I'd like to refine the search without running over
              the entire list again. I should be able to do a new search that
              only looks at those 50 messages.
        * Support different pagers and CRT values based on command and
          possibly terminal type
            * e.g. CRT full screen for the find command, but 0 for viewing
              mail.
            * Might want to disable paging or have a very bit CRT when using
              tmux so that you get its scroll-back buffer instead.
        * Support better editing of message structure
            * Biggest example is being able to edit an attachement, even
              when there isn't a real file backing it.
