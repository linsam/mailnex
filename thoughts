Where we are, where we should go, etc.


Right now, we are a basicly functional mailx replacement. We can do
OpenPGP-MIME email (send and receive), though some clients don't display our
messages correctly in this case (e.g. MS Outlook with GPG4Win OL plugin).

We neither send nor receive inline OpenPGP (which is what MS Outlook wants to
send). However, the user can fake that by setting their editor (e.g. using vim
to edit a message can filter parts to gpg) for sending, or writing the part to
gpg for receiving.


We are somewhat lacking in performance for slow connections, due to several
things. Firstly, we primarily act as an online IMAP client, which means
everything is actively asked for on the server. We sped some of this up (quite
a bit) by having a session cache, but we only trust it for unchanging data
(e.g. message content), so every time we want to list messages, we re-fetch
flags, for example. We also poll the server to get new messages instead of
going IDLE when the server supports it. This means we have a bit of a delay in
seeing messages, and also that we round-trip more.

The delays aren't usually noticable in a LAN, unless the server is busy. The
main reason I did the session cache was to simplify message decryption and
signature verification, not to improve general performance.

However, move to a dial-up connection, or VPN over cellular network, and
things get pretty painful pretty quickly.



The first things we can do to speed some stuff up are to support IDLE and let
the server tell us when flags change, and cache that. Not having to re-fetch
flags for every list will help a lot.

The second thing to do would be to cache (some) things to disk. This would
require us to switch from being an on-line client to an offline client. This
has many drawbacks, so it needs some evaluation. In particular, we would need
to keep track of UIDVALIDITY and message UIDs. Initial connections will become
slower as we need to synchronize the UID to message ID lists at a minimum.
Code also becomes more complicated, because all of the network optimizations
to synchronize quicker are optional extensions, so the code would have to have
fallbacks for servers that don't support the extensions (or, we'd have to fail
connecting to some servers).

The biggest problem with that is we lose our connect-and-go feature inherited
from mailx. Heirloom-mailx did have some offline imap support, but I never
played with it. IIRC it consisted of saving selected messages for later
viewing. We could default to connect-and-go and have a command to switch to
caching or offline mode for the given connection (where offline is the same as
caching except we fill the whole cache at connect/sync instead of on-demand).
In offline mode, we'd need a way to *be* offline, that is, accept a connection
string with the folder command but not actually connect, just look at the
cache. Worse, we'd probably need to handle delayed message sending. That's
easy if local sendmail is used (we can let it do the queueing for us), but
we'd need to queue for SMTP accounts. We'd also need to handle queued commands
that involve changing flags (seen, deleted) expunging, copying, etc.

We could probably forgo some of that by not actually supporting the full
offline mode, and just do on-demand caching.

This is actually also needed for our search index; basing it on message ID
goes very awry if any messages are removed, causing the handles used in the DB
to become very wrong. Also, searches will find messages that don't exist
anymore, and thus cannot be displayed.



A third thing to do (possibly before the second) is to tie in the IMAP lib
with the event handler. This might also be needed in order to support IDLE.


A fourth thing to do would be to become a tad more asynchronous (having IMAP
lib tie into event handler will help). For example, there can be a noticable
delay after viewing a message before the prompt is displayed, because we are
waiting for the IMAP server to acknowledge that we set the \Seen flag.

Waiting is convenient (we can display an immediate error, and the code is
simpler). Not waiting would probably also require us to implement some of the
queueing needed for offline support, since during the wait we are
desynchronized.



Some other thoughts
-------------------

We could parse through the headline string to decide what parts we actually
need to fetch. For example, maybe the user isn't even showing flags in the
headline. Or additional things could be shown (such as the first N characters
of the main body of the message). Fetching only the parts that are actually
used would make things faster.

Several mail systems now show a simple preview (the first N characters
referenced above). For examples: K-9, Gmail, sup.

Sorting and Threading: the RFCs have some thoughts on sorting and threading.
If we cache enough metadata, we can do those and more. My personal ideal is
the full reference threading with most-recent-child sorting at the root (ala
kmail, sup, and gmail). Observationally, k-9 doesn't do full aggregation on
connect, but rather updates its aggregation as messages are loaded in. This
makes their connection fast and mostly still relevant.

The RFCs seem to combine threading with sorting, which I find odd. Sometimes
it is related. How do you sort the list of conversations by subject when a
thread changes subject part-way through? How do you sort the conversations
list by author? A potential answer is by showing the conversation in multiple
spots. For example, when sorting by author, a conversation by Bob, Sally and
Zelda could show up under all 3's headers.

KMail handled this by sepparating sorting and aggregation.



Another useful thing would be to stop switching into and out of
prompt_toolkit. It would be better to make it a long-running UI (like in full
screen mode), but with the single-prompt layout (so that terminal scroll
buffer and such still works).


To peruse a conversation, I'd like to use an internal viewer instead of 'less'
or 'more' so that messages and quoted blocks can be collapsed (for example,
gmail's Inbox collapses \Seen messages in a conversation by default. Sup
allows collapsing messages and block quotes for quickly navigating a
conversation.). Mailnex should switch to full-screen alternate-screen mode to
do that. I don't know yet if prompt_toolkit can do that on-the-fly, or if it
can be via a sub-application, or if we need a whole new instance. I want to
avoid the new instance bit, to reduce trouble we have with the eventloop
getting keyboard input with no where to send it.


Anatomy of the default prompt
-----------------------------

prompt_toolkit allows for fancy(ish) layouts to be created and customized. For
the convenience of the common case (simple prompt), it wraps all the advanced
stuff for you. We would like to do some advanced stuff, so we have to set it
up ourselves. Here's how thats to be done:

First, some processors are created. HighlightSearchProcessor (if search buffer
has focus), HighlightSelectionProcessor, AppendAutoSuggestion (if
default_buffer has focus and not isDone), and PasswordProcessor if the prompt
was created with is_password (or is_password is a filter, can enable/disable
this on-the-fly, e.g. via key binding). Additional processors may be appended
upon invokation, but the above set cannot be replaced. Finally, a
DefaultPrompt filter is created that shows either the prompt
(prompt_tokens_2), 'arg', or 'reverse-i-search', when not in multiline)

Second, a tollbars list is made with a conditional container with a window for
the tokens passed to the function, set for a height of 1 row. Only renders if
not isDone and RenderHeightIsKnown.

Finally, the main layout is built. It is an hslpit with a floatContainer,
ValidationToolar, SystemToolbar, ArgToolbar (if multiline), SearchToolbar (if
multiline), then the toolbars list from above.

The floatContainer has an HSplit, then a list of items, consisting of a
CompletionsMenu, a MultiColumnCompletionsMenu, and a right prompt. The HSplit
has 2 Windows, one for the prompt (prompt_tokens_1), and one for the actual
buffer. Both Windows do some magic-ish stuff. The prompt doesn't extend
height, and the main buffer does something fancy with left_margins.

Note the difference between prompt_tokens_1 and prompt_tokens_2. The user only
passes one set of tokens. The _1 and _2 are built from a splitting function on
the single passed set. prompt_tokens_1 is all of the lines of the prompt
except the first, and prompt_tokens_2 is just the first line, only.

This means that the first line of the prompt is prepended to the text via a
processor, and the remaining lines are done by an explicit window.

I don't understand the point of it, though. Observationally, in not-multiline
mode, the text entered wraps around the window to below the prompt. Even with
a multiline prompt, the text starts at the end of the prompt and wraps to
underneath. In multiline mode, the text entered does not wrap below the
prompt, but rather stays aligned with the first non-prompt character, making
it look like it is actually in its own window. Interestingly, in this case the
window starts after the last character of the prompt, which isn't necessarily
the longest line of the prompt.

Singleline mode (prompt in english, characters typed as '.'s):
 -----------------------------------------
|Sample prompt with a long line           |
|your command?  ..... .. ...... .... .....|
|... .... .......... ... .....            |
 -----------------------------------------

Multiline mode
 -----------------------------------------
|Sample prompt with a long line           |
|your command?  ..... .. ...... .... .....|
|               ... .... .......... ... ..|
|               ...                       |
 -----------------------------------------

OH, I misread. It does the iteration and insertion backwards. Thus,
prompt_tokens_1 is all except the last line, and prompt_tokens_2 is just the
last line.

When not multiline, the last line of the prompt is a processor to prepend the
prompt to the screen. When in multiline, the processor is inactive, but the
window gets a PromptMargin containing the last line of the prompt.

Part of my interpretation problem is HSplit and VSplit being different than HStack and VStack.

Thus, the stack is roughly this:

------------------------------------------------------------------
 Float                                                  <rprompt>
   ------------------------------------------------
   prompt_start tokens
   ------------------------------------------------
   command window
     (margin or processor to display prompt end)
   ------------------------------------------------
   <completions>
------------------------------------------------------------------
 Validation TB
------------------------------------------------------------------
 System TB
------------------------------------------------------------------
 Arg TB
------------------------------------------------------------------
 Search TB
------------------------------------------------------------------
 <custom TBs>
------------------------------------------------------------------


This is very featureful.

The next question is, do we try to modify it, duplicate it, or go our own way.
Modifying would probably involve tweaking the buffer after the object is
created such that the AcceptAction calls our command handler, rather than
returning a value we pass to the command handler. Duplicating it would be
copying all the creation code to accomplish the same thing. I don't *think* we
need all the features, so we could go our own way a bit and make a simpler
prompt layout.

The crux of this is, can we have it keep the layout and call us rather than us
calling them, and not destroy the old prompts. (that is, terminal history
should be readable)


One of the other things I originally wanted to accomplish was to have the
completions pop-up above the prompt instead of below. We could only redraw
what was under the popup if we knew what was there already, so having some
minimal number of output lines during startup would be neccessary. However,
I'm no longer certain that this is feasible.


Doing our own viewer will probably require us to make our own UIControl.
Otherwise, handling scrolling and selections might be difficult or impossible.


Another issue that is annoying to see is that free-flow output (e.g. when first connecting) doesn't maintain the prompt height (we are using 9 rows of the terminal right now). This is distracting to the user (mostly me) because usually my eye is in the output section, and now has to go to the input section briefly. We might be able to maintain a top-side window to put such stuff in, but it probably would be painful.

Additional info on the event loops
----------------------------------

The eventloop that comes with prompt_toolkit allows for other event loops to
be run so long as its loop is idle. It then expects your loop to return to its
loop when you see something ready for it. They have an example of this in
examples/inputhook.py, where they call a gtk eventloop while idle. It might be
more stable for us to do the same thing, except calling pyuv instead of gtk.


Threading display.

An example set of messages with the view most people do. Siblings are at the
same indentation level under a parent.

  1
  \_ 2
  |  \_ 3
  |  \_ 4
  |     \_ 5
  \_ 6
     \_ 7
     |  \_ 8
     \_ 9
  10
   \_ 11

In the above example, there are 2 conversations (threaded message trees),
rooted at 1 and 10.
1 has two children, 2 and 6. 2 and 6 are siblings. 2 has two children as well,
3 and 4. 6 likewise has two children, 7 and 9. 1 thus has 4 grandchildren: 3,
4, 7, and 9.

This often results in a list like this:


 a
 \_ b
    \_ c
       \_ d
          \_ e
             \_ f
                \_ g
                |  \_h
                \_ i
                   \_ j
                      \_ k
                         \_ l
                            \_ m

That is, the tree of messages is mostly a list of messages, an the severe
indenting can be distracting. In the case of mailx, the indenting can make it
hard to trace a message number to the message, since there is a LOT of white
space. I have found myself resorting to the mouse to highlight a line to find
the number of the message I wanted to view.

I'd want an ordering that assumes the trees are mostly lists. Since most
children are an only child, and rarely are there 2 or more siblings, I can
think of a couple better ways to present the thread. We can maintain depth on
first child, and increment depth for subsequent children for example. This
results in lists that look like this:

  1
  \_ 6
  |  \_ 9
  |  7
  |  8
  2
  \_ 4
  |  5
  3

  10
  11

and

 a
 b
 c
 d
 e
 f
 \_i
   j
   k
   l
   m
 g
 h

There are a couple problems with this layout. First, there is no way to tell
when a new conversation starts. If, like in kmail or thunderbird, we want to
show individual message of all conversations in the same list, there isn't
good separation between conversations (I show an empty line above message 10
for this example). If we only show conversations in the list (like google's
Inbox or sup), this isn't an issue, and we can show the conversation
threadlist as a virtual folder style view when a conversation is selected. We
could reserve the no-indentation slot for thread leaders, then follow this for
first children on down.

Second, the ordering feels weird. More recent messages end up being displayed
first, and we can still get pretty deep on indentation depending on how the
conversation flows.

Another option would be to use the last sibling to be at the same level as the
parent. That would help with date ordering, but probably wouldn't help the
indentation issue; it relies on messages occurring a different order.

A third option would be to keep the child with the deepest descendantry
(opposite of ancestry) as the first. This still has the issue of date order
oddness, but should keep the most messages shallow. A variant would be to use
descendant count instead of max depth for this. I'm not sure yet which would
be better. Either way, on a tie, try to maintain date/message ordering. 
Also note, if the tree isn't doubly linked, when a new message comes in, we'll
have to recursively recalculate every messages descendant depth and descendant
count all over again. (If it is doubly linked, we can just walk up the tree to
update the numbers, witch can be iterative instead)

1
\_ 2
|  \_ 3
|  4
|  5
\_ 6
   \_ 9
   7
   8
10
\_ 11


a
\_ b
   c
   d
   e
   f
   \_ g
   |  h
   i
   j
   k
   l
   m


Other options include date/message order descendant ordering (most recent
child stays left), most rescent descendant date ordering (child with the
newest sub-conversation stays left). The issue with these is that the tree
view can shift a bit more dramatically when a new message comes in, which
could be disorienting for the user.

Here's an example using real threads that I've been in, with the subjects and
senders changed.  First in "standard" representation:

-----------------------------------------------

RFC 2822 specifies "Re: " prefix for replies. It mentions forwarding messages,
but does not describe how to indicate such in the subject. Some email clients
use "RE: ", "re: ", and the first two letters of the local word for
"regarding"  in spite of RFC 2822 indicating "Re" is short for the latin "Res"
meaining "in the matter of" or something like that.

In spite of RFC 2822 specifying "Re: " be added as prefix, RFC 5256 only
specifies removing "re: " (lower case) from the subject when forming a
base-subject (and a bunch of forwarding and identifier texts). It does
explicitly call out being case-sensitive when matching Message-IDs, so one
might assume to be case insensitive for the "re: " prefix. Experience shows
that when characters are used in ABNF, they are used insensitively (e.g. for
IMAP, I can do 'uid search' or 'UID SEARCH' and the server doesn't care, even
though it is in ABNF as ["UID" SP] "SEARCH". 

Actually, RFC 5234 section 2.3 explicitly calls out that ABNF strings in
quotes are US-ASCII encoded, case-insensitive strings. So, all of the "re" and
"fwd" stuff must be matched insensitively as one would expect it should!

-------------------------------------------------

RFC 5256 specifies that a thread can exist without the thread leader, and
immediately have siblings at the top level that /aren't/ siblinbs of root's
other children. This happens when messages in a thread have the same parent,
but the parent didn't make it into the message set (perhaps the user doesn't
have a copy of the parent).

E.G. Message 4 is the leader. Messages 7 and 9 are its children. Message 4
gets deleted (so now messages 7 and 9 are 6 and 8). Messages 5, 6, and 8 (now
4, 5, and 7) are single messages. The IMAP THREAD representation is
(4)(5)((6)(8))(7) (before, it would have been (4 ((7)(9)))(5)(6)(8) )

So, the question is... how do we display that in (semi)graphical tree style!?‽
We might be able to do it with unicode line drawing for standard style. E.g.

  ╶ 4       Going on vacation
  ╶ 5       Enhance your nightlife!
  ┌ 6       re: Something funny
  └ 8       re: Something funny
  ╶ 7       This neat trick will...

before it would have been

  ╶ 4       Something funny
    ├ 7     re: Something funny
    └ 9     re: Something funny
  ╶ 5       Going on vacation
  ╶ 6       Enhance your nightlife!
  ╶ 8       This neat trick will...

But what about ASCII, and what about our condensed tree style?

Perhaps:

  before, normal or condensed (same representation)
  4
  \_ 7
  \_ 9
  5
  6
  8

  after, normal or condensed (same representation)
  4
  5
  __ 6
  \_ 8
  7

What about collapsed threads? We'll have to collapse on first child
