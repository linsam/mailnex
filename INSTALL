Method 1:
    run:
        virtualenv --system-site-packages env
        source env/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    Install python-xapian using your system package manager (e.g. apt-get install python-xapian)
    If you want it to remember passwords, install appropriate keyring managers (TODO: name the packages)

    run directly: ./mailnex

Method 2: (for when the above method results in problems with function calls)
    run:
        virtualenv env
        source env/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    Follow instructions at https://gist.github.com/josezambrana/920909. We use
    version 1.2.23 instead of 1.2.18. We didn't bother installing the haystack
    packages (django-haystack, xapian-haystack)

    If you want it to remember passwords, good luck. Probably your best bet is
    to do 'pip install keyring.alt' and configure plain-text password storage.

    run directly: ./mailnex
