Installing from package
    run:
        virtualenv --system-site-packages env
        source env/bin/activate
        pip install mailnex-0.0.tar.gz
    You'll additionally need python-xapian from your system package manager
    (e.g. apt-get install python-zapian)

    Then, you can run directly: mailnex


Installing from source

Method 1:
    run:
        virtualenv --system-site-packages env
        source env/bin/activate
        python setup.py install

    Install python-xapian using your system package manager (e.g. apt-get install python-xapian)
    If you want it to remember passwords, install appropriate keyring managers (TODO: name the packages)

    run directly: mailnex

Method 2: (for when the above method results in problems with function calls)
    run:
        virtualenv env
        source env/bin/activate
        python setup.py install

    Follow instructions at https://gist.github.com/josezambrana/920909. We use
    version 1.2.23 instead of 1.2.18. We didn't bother installing the haystack
    packages (django-haystack, xapian-haystack)

    If you want it to remember passwords, good luck. Probably your best bet is
    to do 'pip install keyring.alt' and configure plain-text password storage.

    run directly: mailnex


Running without installation

    e.g. when doing development:

    Setup a virtualenv as above, then run:

        python setup.py develop

    That adds a mailnex script to the virtualenv or system path that calls the
    code in the project directory and installs all dependencies. Then you can
    simply run it directly:

        mailnex
